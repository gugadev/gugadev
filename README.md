I love coding, solving problems and creating new things! Since was a child i like computers, was fascinated about them. A bit later, I starting to coding my first tools. I like technology in general terms, but my favorite topics are React, RxJs, Node.js, deno, Angular, Firebase, TypeScript, Swift & SwiftUI, Flutter, and some others. Currently, i'm working on a personal project that mixes technology and 🐕 .

<h1 align="center">Hi there! üëã</h1>

I'm Gustavo, **Senior Frontend Engineer** currently working at [Globant](https://globant.com). I love coding, solving problems and creating new things! I like computers since I was a child, I was always fascinated about them. A bit later, I started to coding my first apps, websites and tools. Currently, I'm working on a side project that mixes technology and üêï .

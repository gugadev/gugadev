## Hi there! 👋

I'm Gustavo, frontend engineer currently working at [Globant](https://globant.com) and Frontend Lead at the most important digital product of a big national company (Peru). I love coding, solving problems and creating new things! I like computers since I was a child, I was always fascinated about them. A bit later, I started to coding my first apps, websites and tools. I like technology overall, but my favorite topics are `React, React Native, Dart/Flutter, Swift/SwiftUI, C#, TypeScript, Angular, Nest and Firebase`, and doing some things with new tools like Qwik, Solid and Svelte. Currently, i'm working on a side project that mixes technology and 🐕 .

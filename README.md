<h1 align="center">Hi there! 👋</h1>

I'm Gustavo, frontend engineer currently working at [Globant](https://globant.com) and Frontend Lead at the most important digital product of a big national company (Peru). I love coding, solving problems and creating new things! I like computers since I was a child, I was always fascinated about them. A bit later, I started to coding my first apps, websites and tools. I like technology overall, but my favorite topics are `React, React Native, Dart/Flutter, Swift/SwiftUI, Kotlin/Compose, C#, TypeScript, Angular, Nest and Firebase`, and doing some things with new tools like Qwik, Solid and Svelte. Currently, i'm working on a side project that mixes technology and 🐕 .

## Featured projects

- Aprendo en Casa: Flutter (with modules developed by hand in Swift and Kotlin) application for the [Ministerio de Educación del Perú](https://www.gob.pe/minedu) that helped teachers and students to teach and study in the pandemic period.
- Tapuy: Flutter & PWA application for the national water administrator entity (SEDAPAL). This application is used by people in extreme poverty to inform to SEDAPAL how much water (and in which conditions) they are receiving, as well drivers to notify people the water cistern is coming to these clanships.
